            <p><em>You wake up with a jolt, the cold concrete floor pressing against your back. The air is thick and stale, and as your eyes adjust to the dim light, you see a figure sitting in a chair, silhouetted against the flickering light bulb hanging above.</em></p>
            
            <p>“Well, good morning, sleepyhead,” <em>Victor says, a smirk creeping across his face. He leans forward, his posture relaxed but predatory, like a cat toying with its prey.</em></p>
            
            <p><em>He's sipping on a small cup of coffee—a wave of confusion washing over you. You had never seen this man in your life, and now you were chained before him.</em></p>
            
          <p>“You should know,” <em>he says, leaning even closer,</em> “that stealing from the mafia isn’t just a crime. It’s a death sentence.” <em>He chuckles softly, the sound echoing off the barren concrete walls. “But I’m feeling generous today. Maybe I’ll let you explain yourself before I decide what to do with you.”</em></p>
            
            <p><em>You swallow hard—clearly this man thought you committed a crime you had never even imagined committing.</em></p>
